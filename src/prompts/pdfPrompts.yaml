    Your goal is to create a short warmup task that activates and refreshes relevant background knowledge for the lesson information provided.
    --------------------
    Learning Objectives - ${lessonObjectives}
    --------------------
    Class Context - 50% of students are performing below grade level and find it challenging to access the curriculum.
    --------------------
    Here are tips for creating a great warmup task -
    ~ Think about the specific skills and knowledge students will need to access today’s lesson
    ~ If they're provided, you can draw on the original curriculum warmup and teacher response to original warmup
    ~ The warmup should be focused on a single short scenario with up to 3 subparts
    ~ Some subparts should be accessible for all students
    ~ The warmup should take no more than 5 minutes to complete in class
    ~ The task should be student-facing and not need anything else for students to complete it
    ~ Do not provide a title. Do not provide anything apart from the task. Provide response in natural language, do not use latex
    ~ The output should be short, concise and clear. Good warmups usually have 40-100 words
    ~ Think step-by-step
    --------------------
    Now, create the warmup task.

    You are an expert Grade 6 math teacher. Please create a short learning resource that helps develop students' mathematical language. This will be particularly helpful for students who are learning English. Information on today's lesson is below. 

    Today’s Lesson: 
    
    ${lessonObjectives}
    
    For this lesson, create a resource with the following sections, following the format outlined. Do not output anything else. 
    
    Title: Building Mathematical Language about... 
    
    Key Word 1

    2. Sentence Stems: 
    
    [For the lesson, write a set of 5 helpful and simple sentence starters and frames for students to use in their conversations and responses to questions. These should help develop their mathematical language. These should reference the specific tasks they will do in the lesson.]

    Output instructions:
    - Begin with a standard HTML5 doctype and structure the document with a clear hierarchy of sections
    - Design layout to be clean and organized, have a bright and engaging color scheme
    - Include large blank areas for student responses
    - Ensure the document is styled with colorful CSS that is embedded within the HTML for ease of sharing and printing.
    - The HTML document should be single-paged and designed with printability in mind, keeping in mind the standard margins and format of a letter-sized document for easy printing.
problemPairs:

    You are an expert middle school math teacher. You also possess significant expertise in direct instruction. For the learning objectives and standard you are going to create an example problem pair task. 

    1. First, for the standard and learning objectives, write a set of questions that gradually build in difficulty and challenge that cover the key skills embedded in the standard. Write as many questions as needed to cover the standard and learning objectives. 

    2. Check that the questions cover the standard and learning objectives. Rewrite the questions if needed. 

    3. For each question, write a similar question that has the same mathematical structure but changes the numbers and, if appropriate, the context too. This question will be completed by students immediately after their teacher has shown them the example. 

    Standard: ${lessonStandards}
    Learning Objectives: ${lessonObjectives}

    Please provide your response as a list of questions.
    
exitTicket:
  system: |
    You are an expert middle school math teacher. You have particular expertise in formative assessment. For the lesson being taught below, write a short exit ticket for students. This should be a short task (e.g. 1-3 questions) that test whether students have understood the learning objectives. Follow this process: 

    1. Determine the key skills embedded in the learning objectives. 
    2. Write questions that test whether students have learnt these key skills.

    Generate a JSON array of objects in the following format. Each object can be of type "text" or "shape". For "text" objects, include the fields "text", "width", "height", "scaleX", "scaleY", "translateX", and "translateY". For "shape" objects, include the fields "shapeType", "width", "height", "scaleX", "scaleY", "translateX", and "translateY". The "shapeType" field should specify the type of shape, such as "RECTANGLE".  All measurement fields will use PT units.. This json will be fed into the Google slides API. 
    
    Example format:
    [
      {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "Finding the Area of 3D Objects",
        "width": 300,
        "height": 50,
        "scaleX": 1,
        "scaleY": 1,
        "translateX": 50,
        "translateY": 50
      },
      {
        "type": "shape",
        "shapeType": "RECTANGLE",
        "width": 300,
        "height": 50,
