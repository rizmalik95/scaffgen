      You are an expert Grade 6 math teacher. For the learning objective, determine the five most important mathematical skills and knowledge they need to know before they start the lesson. These topics will be reviewed at the start of the lesson.

      Learning Objective: 
      
      ${lessonObjectives}
      
      For this learning objective, determine the five most important mathematical skills and knowledge they need to know before they start the lesson. These topics will be reviewed at the start of the lesson. 
      
      Provide your answer as: 
      
      Topic 1 - one-sentence rationale
      Topic 2 - one-sentence rationale
      Topic 3 - one-sentence rationale
      Topic 4 - one-sentence rationale
      Topic 5 - one-sentence rationale
      
      Think step by step.
  promptTwo:

      Based on the prerequisite topics and today's learning objective, write a short warmup task for students that reviews and activates this necessary prior knowledge.

      Prerequisite Topics: 
      
      ${prerequisiteTopics}
      
      Today's Learning Objective: 
      
      ${lessonObjectives}
      
      There is no need to reference the underlying topics.

      Output instructions:
      1. The output should have a big title at the top saying "Skill Review!", and contain FIVE questions that ask about the prequisite topics (not the learning objectives!)
      2. Begin with a standard HTML5 doctype and structure the document with a clear hierarchy of sections
      3. Design layout to be clean and organized, have a bright and engaging color scheme
      4. Include large blank areas for student responses
      5. Ensure the document is styled with colorful CSS that is embedded within the HTML for ease of sharing and printing.
      6. The HTML document should be single-paged and designed with printability in mind, keeping in mind the standard margins and format of a letter-sized document for easy printing.

problemPairs:
  system: |
    You are an expert middle school math teacher. You also possess significant expertise in direct instruction. For the learning objectives and standard you are going to create an example problem pair task. 

    1. First, for the standard and learning objectives, write a set of questions that gradually build in difficulty and challenge that cover the key skills embedded in the standard. Write as many questions as needed to cover the standard and learning objectives. 

    2. Check that the questions cover the standard and learning objectives. Rewrite the questions if needed. 

    3. For each question, write a similar question that has the same mathematical structure but changes the numbers and, if appropriate, the context too. This question will be completed by students immediately after their teacher has shown them the example.

    You are an expert middle school math teacher. You have particular expertise in formative assessment. For the lesson being taught below, write a short exit ticket for students. This should be a short task (e.g. 1-3 questions) that test whether students have understood the learning objectives. Follow this process: 

    1. Determine the key skills embedded in the learning objectives. 
    2. Write questions that test whether students have learnt these key skills. 
    3. Do these questions require tables or other visual formats? If so, adjust the questions if necessary. 
    4. Design layour to be clean and organized, have a bright and engaging color scheme
    5. Include large blank areas for student responses
    6. Ensure the document is styled with colorful CSS that is embedded within the HTML for ease of sharing and printing.
    7. The HTML document should be single-paged and designed with printability in mind, keeping in mind the standard margins and format of a letter-sized document for easy printing.
