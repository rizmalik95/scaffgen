    Learning Objectives: ${lessonObjectives}
    Standard: ${lessonStandards}
    --------------------
    Class Context: 50% of students are performing below grade level and find it challenging to access the curriculum.
    --------------------
    Here are tips for creating a great warmup task:
    - Think about the specific skills and knowledge students will need to access today’s lesson
    - If they're provided, you can draw on the original curriculum warmup and teacher response to original warmup
    - The warmup should be focused on a single short relevant scenario with up to 3 related subparts within that same scenario
    - Some subparts should be accessible for all students
    - The warmup should take no more than 5 minutes to complete in class
    - The task should be student-facing and not need anything else for students to complete it
    - Do not provide a title. Do not provide anything apart from the task. Provide response in raw text
    - The output should be short, concise and clear. Good warmups usually have 40-100 words
    - Think step-by-step
    --------------------
    Now, create the warmup task.
    Output instructions:
    - Begin with a standard raw text file and structure it clearly hierarchy of sections
    - Output only the raw text document code and nothing else

    Today’s Lesson:
    Learning Objectives ${lessonObjectives}
    Standard: ${lessonStandards}
    --------------------
    Class Context: 50% of students are performing below grade level and find it challenging to access the curriculum.
    --------------------
    Here are tips for creating a great task that prompts student use of mathematical language
    - Think about the specific skills and knowledge students will need to access today’s lesson
    - The key words should be central to the lesson skills and objective
    - Some key words should be accessible for all students
    - The task should be student-facing and not need anything else for students to complete it
    - Do not provide anything apart from the task. Provide response in raw text
    - Think step-by-step
    For this lesson, create a resource with the following sections, following the format outlined. Do not output anything else.
    Title: Building Mathematical Language
    Key Word 1: [KEY WORD 1]
    Definition: [Definition of KEY WORD 1]
    Example: [Example of KEY WORD 1]
    Key Word 2: [KEY WORD 2]
    Definition: [Definition of KEY WORD 2]
    Example: [Example of KEY WORD 2]
    Key Word 3: [KEY WORD 3]
    Definition: [Definition of KEY WORD 3]
    Example: [Example of KEY WORD 3]
    For this lesson, have students write a sentence that includes the word [KEY WORD] and [APPLICATION WORD], a term that is integral to the real-world application of [KEY WORD].
    Title: Now apply the key words!

    Learning Objectives: ${lessonObjectives}
    Standard: ${lessonStandards}
    --------------------
    Class Context: 50% of students are performing below grade level and find it challenging to access the curriculum.
    --------------------
    Here are tips for creating a great problem pair task:
    - Think about the specific skills and knowledge students will need to access today’s lesson
    - The problem pair task should progress in difficulty but be paired on the same level so that students can properly replicate the work
    - Some pairs should be accessible for all students
    - The task should be student-facing and not need anything else for students to complete it
    - Do not provide anything apart from the task. Provide response in raw text
    - Think step-by-step
    1. First, for the standard and learning objectives, write a set of four questions that gradually build in difficulty and challenge that cover the key skills embedded in the standard. Ensure that the questions cover the standard and learning objectives.
    2. Check that the questions cover the standard and learning objectives. Rewrite the questions if needed.
    3. For each question, write a similar question that has the same mathematical structure but changes the numbers and, if appropriate, the context too. This question will be completed by students immediately after their teacher has shown them the example.
    Now, create the problem pairs. Each problem pair should have an "I try" and "you try" format as follows:
    Problem Pair 1:
    I try: [Insert question here]
    You try: [Insert similar question here]
    Problem Pair 2:
    I try: [Insert question here]
    You try: [Insert similar question here]
    Problem Pair 3:
    I try: [Insert question here]
    You try: [Insert similar question here]
    Problem Pair 4:
    I try: [Insert question here]
    You try: [Insert similar question here]

    - Begin with a standard raw text file and structure it clearly hierarchy of sections

    You are an expert middle school math teacher with particular expertise making high-quality professional presentation slides.
  user: |
    Your goal is to create a JSON array of objects that will be used to create a Google Slides presentation via the Google Slides API.
    --------------------
    Specific Instructions --
    ~ Each object can be of type "text" or "shape"
    ~ For "text" objects, provide fields "text", "width", "height", "scaleX", "scaleY", "translateX", "translateY", "textColor", "bold", "fontFamily", and "fontSize".
    ~ For "shape" objects, include the fields "shapeType", "width", "height", "scaleX", "scaleY", "translateX", "translateY", "backgroundColor", "outlineColor", and "outlineWeight".
    ~ The "shapeType" field should specify the type of shape, it must be one of "RECTANGLE", "ROUND_RECTANGLE", "ELLIPSE", "CLOUD", or "DIAMOND". All measurement fields will use PT units.
    ~ The maximum width of the Google Slide is 720 and the maximum height is 405. Objects MUST NOT go out of these bounds. This means that width + translateX cannot exceed 720 and height + translateY cannot exceed 405.
    --------------------
    Design Instructions --
    ~ Every slide should have a simple title, e.g. "Warmup: Mixing Colors"
    ~ The main content should be in a text box
    ~ The original content should NOT be changed
    ~ Ideally include a 0.5in margin of white space
    ~ Implement spacing between questions and lines
    ~ The background color should be light minimal pink
    ~ Think step-by-step
