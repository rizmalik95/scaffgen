We plan to build a simple tool that takes in a teacher’s curricular materials and provides a set of curated scaffolded activities that supplement and support these materials. Some of these outputs will be LLM-created and some others will be human-written. 

### User Story
Teacher X is preparing a lesson on the quadratic equation from the curricular resources they have been provided by their district. However, these materials do not include sufficient opportunities for practice, nor are they tailored to the specific needs of their students. Teacher X can upload or link to their curriculum, and our tool provides a set of classroom-ready, customizable instructional scaffolds, including: (1) additional practice questions (written by expert teachers), (2) suggested real-world connections (generated by LLM), and (3) other interactive classroom activities

## Sprint Updates

### Ronak

In this sprint, I worked with everyone else to primarily scope our project, come up with the most essential features and system design. I helped brainstorm the different technology stacks nad how we will connect different pieces of software together and store our data. We talked with the Khanmigo team, and then as a group discussed how we can differentiate ourselves from what Khan Academy already offers. On the technical side, I first worked with Ritika to scrape Resourceaholic website for pdf scaffolds. Then, I started working on connecting our Python scripts to the frontend T3 app that we have built. This part is unfinished, so I will continue it in the next sprint. 

For the next sprint, my goal is first finish connecting the two scraping scripts we have (the resourceaholic scraper for scaffolds, and the illustrative mathematics scraper for lessons) to the frontent in Typescript, so that they can be surfaced by frontend components. Then, I want to work on two things. One, populating databases with our scraped information, instead of current method of computing on the fly, so we only have to make these scrapes once. Two, I will work with Ritika to build logic for the LLM to match relevant scaffolds with the current lesson plan. 

### Ritika
This past sprint, we spent a lot of time defining our solution and making sure we were addressing the main problem that Riz had identified in his previous user research. Most of the first week was brainstorming ideas, and clearly identifying what we needed to code. Towards the end of the first week, Ronak and I wrote one of our scraping scripts to create our human-written scaffolds for middle school math formatted as a list of tuples in the following format: (Scaffold Name, Author, Link URL if it is a PDF, Answer URL if it exists, 2 Sentence Summary). The next week, I worked on making an API call to read each pdf and provide the 2 sentence summary that we included in our human-written scaffold database.

For sprint 2, I plan to help write our prompts to create LLM generated scaffolds. In speaking with individuals from Khanmigo, they shared that all of their Educational tools are based on prompt engineering and no fine tuning. I think that could be interesting for us to test out at some point, but starting with prompt generation, and helping create another LLM model that’s able to match teacher queries with the GPT summaries we produced.

### Riz
We spent some time narrowing in on the specific problem that we’re hoping to solve. This involved me sharing some of the insights that I’ve gained from qualitative research with teachers over the past few months. This helped us narrow in on two main points of differentiation: (1) connection to teachers’ existing curriculum, and (2) returning teacher-created scaffolds to the teacher, as well as LLM-created ones.
